      <h4>ABOUT AFFILIATION</h4>

            <p class="left-align light">From the beginning, the CrossFit movement has provided an alternative to the prevailing commercial gym establishment and its signature "big-box," machine-based, bodybuilding approach to fitness.</p>

           <p class="left-align light">We promoted the ethic and aesthetic of the garage gym in large part to provide a home and refuge for our more athletic programming, which couldn't find quarter in the commercial gyms. CrossFit is not a franchise and never will be. Our affiliates constitute a confederation of legitimate fitness practitioners united around constantly varied, intense, functional exercise and pooling reliable resources under the CrossFit name.</p>

              <p class="left-align light">Today, with over 12,000 affiliates worldwide, we see ourselves as part of a larger war between the methods, outcomes, and principles of big-box franchises such as the Gold's, Bally's, and 24-Hour Fitnesses and those of our small-box facilities.</p>

            <p class="left-align light">CrossFit affiliation is an Internet-based, grassroots movement started by CrossFitters who wanted their own local CrossFit-equipped gyms, trainers, and communities. It has become a call to all who really care about fitness to get the car out of the garage, pick up some dumbbells, a barbell, a few plates, a pull-up bar, and some rings, and try the Workout of the Day. Inviting a friend to participate compounds the experience. Keep it up and before long you'll need a bigger space. Write us an essay (application), license a name, set up a website, send us photos and you become part of the growing community of CrossFit affiliates. </p>

          <p class="left-align light">For more specific information on the affiliation process, see How to Affiliate. </p>

          <h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>
            <p class="left-align light">
              1. CrossFit Level 1 Certificate<br>
              We require an applicant to be at least a Level 1 Certificate holder before applying for affiliation. We offer Level 1 Certificate Courses several times a year. Please check the link for more information.
        
            <p class="left-align light">
             2. Proof of Insurance<br>U.S. affiliates will be required to submit proof of insurance. Insurance can be purchased from a variety of companies. CrossFit HQ, however, does offer something called the CrossFit Risk Retention Group that we think offers the best insurance for CrossFit affiliates. It is an insurance group formed and run by CrossFit affiliates. You can read more about the RRG here: www.crossfitrrg.com. Please see the Insurance section for more detailed information.<br>
          U.K. Affiliate Insurance requirements are coming soon.</p>
         
             <p class="left-align light">
              3. Website<br>
              Once you are affiliated, you will need to have a live website before we will be able to link you on the CrossFit site. This is our primary vehicle for promoting you; therefore, we expect you maintain a good site. Please do not register a domain with the CrossFit name in it until after your affiliate application has been approved; CrossFit is a licensed trademark and its use without our prior permission is illegal. Please see Website Checklist for more detailed information.<br></p>
